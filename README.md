## About me

### Hi people,

I'm a front-end dev beginner.
I'm studying web development since the beginning of 2020 but I already knew programming language as a hobby since I was 17 years old.
I started taking a Delphi 7 course, soon after I joined a technical course in industrial computing where I learned the basics of C and C++ and fell in love with game development.
I walked away from programming for a while and in 2020 I regained my enthusiasm for programming when I needed a solution to a problem I had been having, which was solved with simple automation.
Since then I have been constantly studying via Udemy, Youtube, W3C, DIO...
I'm enrolled in the technical course of Systems Development (DS) at ETEC de Franca, scheduled to start at the end of July/2021.

Skills learned:
GIT/GITHub,
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Materialize, Javascript/ES6

Studying and putting into practice previous skills:
PHP, Javascript

I intend to study:
Nodejs, Express, Reactjs, react native, Dart, Flutter, Agile development among others.
